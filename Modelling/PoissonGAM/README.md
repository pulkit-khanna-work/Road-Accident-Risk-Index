Here we will demonstrate how to use Poisson GAM algorithm for training and building our model. Also, we will be building training and evaluation plots to better understand the data.

We will be building 3 models:

A Baseline Poisson GAM using mean encoding.

A simpler model with the 7 most important features(explanatory variables) using a combination of mean/target encoding and one hot encoding.

A tuned version of model '2' by optimizing its hyperparamters using grid search
